Thunderbird hangs. I do not have any addons so there is nothing to disable. HOWEVER when I run Thunderbird in Troubleshoot mode with the button for addons disabled --- everything works as it should! I start in regular mode and look for invisible add ons to disable but there are no add ons and no themes. </p><p>I have gone to the Trouble shoot information page. I looked at the Important modified preferences to see if any  network protocol handler was set to false but there are none.   I went to about.config and found several preferences </p><pre>network.protocol-handler.external-default. is set to true and other  </pre> <p>preferences beginning with network.protocol-handler.warn-external. were set to false. Forums said to set them to true to resolve problem. I did that but it did not help. </p><p>I have cleared my cache because - why not! </p><p>I stress that if I run in troubleshoot mode things work. I have been using Thunderbird for 10 years and recently jumped from version 65 to version 128. I do not know when the insert link stopped working. Any ideas besides uninstall reinstall? </p><p><br> SOLVED I cleared my startup cache and that did the trick. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,,accounting61,1730582271,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1472500,44,2024-11-02
